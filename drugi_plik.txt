When creating a reprex by hand, it’s easy to accidentally miss something that means your code can’t be run on someone else’s computer. 
Avoid this problem by using the reprex package. 
It’s installed as part of the tidyverse (will be true soon) or you can install it by itself. 
Go ahead and load it.
